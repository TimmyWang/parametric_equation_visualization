## Purpose of the project
<p> Real world data points live in high dimensional space following underlying structures (that is, dimensions are not independent). The project tries to visualize data in 2D/3D space given predefined structures (parametric equations).

## parametric_equation_visualization.ipynb
<p> where the experiment runs.

## codes
<p> vis.py: defines the class handling 2d/3d parametric equation.
